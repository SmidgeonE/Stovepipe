New default positions were added thanks to @drummerdude2003, for 160+ guns in the vanilla game!


You can now grab the stovepiped round with your hand, as well as get rid of it using inertia.

For ARS/SMGS/BRs, you have to make sure the stovepiped bullet can actually fall out the gun (i.e. its facing towards the floor or it can fall out with inertia). Otherwise, it will not fall out. You can now also grab the bullet.

If you want any changes to any of the positions, DM me (details below).


This is a small mod that implements stovepipe failures for guns. Currently in developement. You can change the probability as your heart desires.

As far as I know, there is no compatibility issue with Meatyceiver.

Some of the bullet poses are slighlty odd (may clip through weapon slightly), because parts of this mod are very hacky :)


# Debug mode

There is now a debug mode, this allows you to update the position / rotation of the bullet as well as allowing you to change the point where the slide stops. To access this, you need to change the failuretoeject.cfg in the config folder in thunderstore, specifically where it says "isDebug" to true.

Next, once you are holding a firearm, you may press right on the joystick you are using to hold the weapon.

This will spawn a debug bullet, you can move this around, you may also manipulate the slide. In debug mode it will stay where it is once you let go. 

To save this, simply press down on the right joystick again and it will save it to User/./AppData/Roaming/StovepipeData/userdefinitions.json.

Currently the debug tool only works for ClosedBolt weapons. If you want this added to pistols, I can, but I think the positions for them are fine as is.


# Note with Debug mode

If you let go of the bullet while its in debug mode, you won't be able to move it again, due to limitations of the physics logic. If you mess up the position, simply restart the debug with joystick right + down.

I will likely add to the defaults.json file, which will improve the default positions over time.

# Changelog

2.2.2 - New default positions created with debug tool. Adjusted default probabilities slightly higher.

2.2.1 - Fixed description + small bug.

2.2.0 - Added debug mode, so you may customise the positions as you please. It also persists so once you've changed it, it will stay! If you want to remove your changes, simply go to User/./AppData/Roaming/Stovepipe/userdefinitions.json and delete the entries you don't like, or delete the entire file if desired.

2.1.2 - Updated description. Don't use new debug mode as it doesn't work yet.

2.1.1 - Fixed crash source

2.1.0 - Added ability to grab the bullet + Use inertia to unstovepipe. Changed default values so they are now lower.

2.0.4 - Changed desc.

2.0.3 - Adjusted so that bullets now take the momentum of the gun after being unstovepiped (so they dont just fly straight down)

2.0.2 - Fixed weird bug where bullet goes crazy on some guns.

2.0.1 - Rifle and Handgun probabilities can now be changed separately. Previous user values should be inherited. Fixed so bullet can fall out when bolt is locked back (i.e. with mp5)

2.0.0 - Expanded to work with closed bolt weapons.

1.1.6 - Fixed bug with reloading scenes.

1.1.5 - Update positions so they are now much better. Also added special case where the bullets eject to the left of the gun.

1.1.4 - Properly fixed issue with caseless ammo :)

1.1.3 - Fixed issue with caseless ammo.

1.1.2 - Fixed more bugs.

1.1.1 - Fixed potential crash source.

1.1.0 - Added ability to un-stovepipe gun with physics interactions (i.e. racking slide with environment). Also tweaked bullet position logic slightly, should be better on most guns (some did get slightly worse though lol)

1.0.0 - Initial release, only works for handguns :)
